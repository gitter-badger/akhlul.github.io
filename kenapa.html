      <p>I'm taking this question to mean most aggregate person-hours logged in a single title during 2013. This is a really tough question to answer, as much of the data is totally unavailable.

<p>But, if I had to make a bet I would place it on Candy Crush Saga.
theverge.com
The Verge reported that over 500 million people have downloaded the game in total, according to the developer. In March of 2013, AppData estimated the game had 46 million average monthly users [1]. As a point of comparison, mega-blockbuster Grand Theft Auto V, the retail game with the highest sales of 2013, sold around 30 million units — an order of magnitude less.

<p>League of Legends Season 3 World Championships, at the Staples Center.

<p>Another contender would be League of Legends, which has 67 million monthly actives as of January 2014 [3], significantly more than Candy Crush (which may have increased its numbers since March, I don't know). But, I would guess that it's actually lower in terms of total hours spent in the game, given how much less casual it is. You can't exactly play League on a train, in the bathroom, etc. That said, I'm more impressed by League's success, since it's available on far fewer platforms, and it's much more difficult to get into.

<p>One interesting sidenote is that, according to a research firm, Dota 2 actually grew faster than League in 2013 even though it had fewer players in the absolute [4]. I wanted to dig into Dota's trajectory a bit more, so I found some historical charts based on Steam player data [5]. I added the next two most played games I could find, Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike: GO, so you could see how absolutely dominant Dota is right now:
